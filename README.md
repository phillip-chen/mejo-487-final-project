# Nearby National Park Map at USA:

This project is to use Google Map API to build a unique map experience hosting a type of geolocation data. I decided to build a National Parks Map in the States, allowing users to query dynamic data and change different geolocation views and information based on different preferences.

Users can use a dropdown list to query national parks near the selected state. (*Note that I removed my API key for the NPS and Google Map API, they are all free, please register and use your own API keys on this app if you want to download my codes)

I use React, a little bit of Tailwind CSS, and Material UI to build out the components, then use the React version of Google Map API and customize the map styling to match the overall design style of the web, and USA National Park Service API to query and visualize the geo data of nearby National Parks' information in different states.

- Skills Demonstrated: *UI Development*, *Responsive Web Design*, *Data Visualization*, *Google Map API*, *Ajax*.
